        <h2>A Quick Band Bio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevelle_(band)">(Full Bio Here)</a></h2>
        <p>
            Chevelle is an American rock band formed in Grayslake, Illinois, in 1995.
            The band was originally composed of two brothers, Pete Loeffler (lead vocals and guitar) and Sam Loeffler (drums and percussion), along with Matt Scott (bass and backing vocals).
            Scott was replaced by Sam and Pete's brother, Joe Loeffler, in 1996. When Joe left the band in 2005, Geno Lenardo subbed in as the touring bassist until he was replaced by Pete and Sam's brother-in-law, Dean Bernardini.
            Bernardini departed from the band in 2019, and in 2021, Kemble Walters joined the band as a touring bassist.
